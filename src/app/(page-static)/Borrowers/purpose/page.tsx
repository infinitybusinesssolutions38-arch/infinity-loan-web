                        Faircent does not consider any cause to be unworthy for a loan. There are no set restrictions on the reason for seeking a loan, other than the obvious condition that the money is not to be used for any illegal or prohibited purpose under Indian laws. Loan requests are for many purposes like:
                    </p>
                    <p className='my-3'>
                        Based on these documents, every borrower will be identity-verified, credit-checked and risk-assessed and our automated system will provide an indication about the Borrower&apos;s capability to efficiently repay the loan. The rate of interest ranges from 12% to 28% and the loan tenure from 6 months to 36 months. With the aim to include those with limited credit history, Faircent has launched the Unrated Borrowers category. This segment of Unrated Borrowers is listed at higher interest rates.
