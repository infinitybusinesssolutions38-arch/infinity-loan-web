                        The registration process is quick and easy. A Borrower simply clicks on the Sign up Now icon, enters some basic information  and uploads the documents required.

                        Based on these documents, every borrower will be identity-verified, credit-checked and risk-assessed and our automated system will provide an indication about the Borrower&apos;s capability to efficiently repay the loan. The rate of interest ranges from 12% to 28% and the loan tenure from 6 months to 36 months. With the aim to include those with limited credit history, Faircent has launched the Unrated Borrowers category. This segment of Unrated Borrowers is listed at higher interest rates.
