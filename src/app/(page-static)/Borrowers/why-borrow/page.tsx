                    <p className='my-3'>
                        Borrowers have always been at the receiving end. Traditionally, it is the lender who decides the amount that a borrower can get as well as the rate of interest. Now, for the first time, Fortune empowers the borrower and makes him an equal to the lender. It is a unique P2P platform that brings potential borrowers and lenders together to facilitate their transactions.

                        Fortune is a fair and open online marketplace where borrowers can borrow money directly from individuals and institutional lenders thereby removing intermediary costs and margins and get better rate of interest as compared to banks and other financial institutions. Credit worthy borrowers can expect multiple lenders interested to fund their requirements.
