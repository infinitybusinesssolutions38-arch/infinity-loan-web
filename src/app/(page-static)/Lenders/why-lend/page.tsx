                    <p className='my-3'>
                        In today&apos;s environment where lending seldom generates expected returns and most of our savings go into paying service charges to financial institutions, Fortune offers a unique opportunity to lend money directly to pre-verified borrowers and earn extra income on idle money.
                    </p>
                    <p className='my-3'>
                        The Fortune model helps earn better rates of interest than the traditional model because it removes the intermediaries and connects the lenders directly to the end users - the borrowers. Fortune brings borrowers and lenders directly in touch with each other, removes intermediary costs, and enables borrowers to access faster and cheaper credit while allowing lenders to earn higher interest on their funds.
                    </p>
                    <p className='my-3'>
                        It is a simple win-win situation so go ahead SIGN UP and start lending because every % counts!
