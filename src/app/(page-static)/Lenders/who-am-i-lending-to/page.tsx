                    <p className='my-3'>
                        Borrowers on Fortune are people who are credit worthy but do not want to pay high interest to banks; people who are smart enough to take charge of their borrowing, just as Lenders are people who want to take control of how they want to invest their idle funds.
                    </p>
                    <p className='my-3'>
                        Fortune provides a bouquet of borrowers with varying credit profiles who would be ready to give different rates of interest depending upon their need and credit worthiness. At Fortune, you can build a portfolio for yourself just the way banks do. We do not allow a lender to fund more than 10% of a borrower&apos;s loan requirement. This is to encourage Lenders to hedge their risk by diversifying their lending portfolio and not put all their eggs in one basket.
                    </p>

                        Fortune has a strict listing criterion for evaluating each and every borrower before they are allowed to be listed on the P2P platform. Fortune physically checks their office and residential addresses, it verifies their income statements, payment capabilities, past performance in order to understand their ability, stability and intent. Fortune evaluates each borrower on more than 120 criteria across 400 data points which includes Financial, Professional, Social and educational background, loan records, etc. to cherry pick only the most eligible borrowers for Lender&apos;s perusal. All such information about each borrower is shared on the borrower listing page so that an informed decision can be taken by Lenders.
