                        With the aim to give more choice to Lenders, Fortune has multiple types of Borrowers and categories of borrowers including those with limited credit history. Sometimes, due to limited data, it is difficult to assess their risk profile and hence, this type of segment of Borrowers is listed at higher interest rates. However, please note that such Borrowers bear a very high risk and loans to these have an increased potential to default. Fortune provides only automated collections support for such Borrowers and categories. Fortune is only an intermediary providing an online platform to connect borrowers and lenders and as such is not liable in any manner for any default of the borrowers. Hence, we urge you to carefully consider the risk involved before offering loans to such high risk Borrowers.

                        The aggregate exposure of a lender to all borrowers at any point of time, across all NBFC-P2P platforms can be increased up to ₹50,00,000/- However, as per regulatory guidelines, to increase the limit beyond ₹10,00,000/- a lender must submit a Net Worth certificate certifying minimum net-worth of ₹50,00,000/- signed by a practicing Chartered Accountant (CA). Fortune facilitates this process at a nominal charge. To know more a lender can contact his Portfolio or Relationship Manager or reach out to us on support@fortune.com.

The first recharge should be for minimum amount of Rs. 50,000/- and all subsequent recharges should be for a minimum amount of Rs. 5000/-. Once the loan transaction with the borrower is complete, Fortune will transfer the amount directly to the borrower&apos;s bank account after deducting any applicable fees and charges.
