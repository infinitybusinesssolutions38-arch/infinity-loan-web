                    <p className='mb-3'>
                        We undertake the role of verifying each and every member registered with us, either as a lender or borrower. For this purpose, we collect personal, professional and financial details from each potential member and authenticate it. The list of information collected is available in the registration section. All the information collected is for official purposes only and we safeguard client confidentiality.
                    </p>
                    <p className='mb-3'>
                        Once a borrower and a lender come to a mutual agreement, Faircent will help them legalize the transaction by getting a formal contract signed by the lender and borrower. We make necessary provisions and help both parties realize the deal without the necessity of a face to face meeting.
                    </p>
                    <p className='mb-3'>
                        Once a loan is disbursed, we help lenders with the collection and recovery of loans. Delay in repayment by borrowers draw a penalty which is pursued by Faircent as part of the process.
