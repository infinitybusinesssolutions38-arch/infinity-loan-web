                            An automated system suggests the loan period, loan amount and interest rate against each Borrower&apos;s profile, which is indicative of the Borrower&apos;s capability to efficiently repay the loan. Lenders can make offers to fund borrower&apos;s requirement which are accepted on first come first serve basis. Thus, lenders can fund a portion of the total loan requirement of multiple borrowers and borrowers can seek to raise money from multiple lenders.

                            Once an agreement is reached between the borrower and the lender, a formal contract is signed by them. The loan amount is then transferred to the borrower&apos;s account and the borrower makes periodic repayments via EMI over the stipulated time period.
