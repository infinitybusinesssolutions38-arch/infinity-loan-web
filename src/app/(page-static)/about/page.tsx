                  Peer to peer lending (or P2P lending) is one of the most innovative financial products of recent times. It enables creditworthy borrowers lower their cost of loans and individual lenders/investors to lend directly to their peers and community thereby earning higher returns.

                  What we at Fortune.com essentially do is provide a virtual market place where borrowers and lenders can interact directly, without having to go through the traditional financial intermediaries like banks, who have become such behemoths in today&apos;s time that they dictate all terms and conditions for both borrowers and lenders. Fortune is India's first peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform to receive a Certificate of Registration (CoR) as an NBFC-P2P from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

                  Banks have massive overheads, with thousands of employees to pay and hundreds of branches to maintain. To maintain profitability, banks must take large margins on the money that passes through them.. Earning out of the difference in interests (what it pays to depositors and what it charges from borrowers) is the main source of revenue for any bank, and has been the key element in the functioning of all traditional financial institutions.
